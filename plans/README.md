# Plans

A plan is a step-by-step task that a coding agent can execute without guessing. Plans are
written after the spec they implement is stable. They are never deleted: their state changes
in the table below.

Format: copy [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md). File name: `NNN-<outcome-in-kebab-case>.md`, where
the name says what is true when the plan is done (for example
`001-mock-approval-reaches-feishu-card.md`).

States: `TODO`, `IN PROGRESS`, `DONE`, `BLOCKED: <reason>`, `REJECTED: <reason>`,
`SUPERSEDED BY NNN`.
